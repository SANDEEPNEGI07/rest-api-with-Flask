## About

This project is a basic REST API implemented using the Flask framework in Python. It provides a foundation for building more complex APIs by offering standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This API is designed to be simple, easy to understand, and a good starting point for developers learning Flask or those needing a quick API solution.

The API targets developers who need to create, manage, and access data through HTTP requests. It is suitable for small to medium-sized projects where a lightweight framework like Flask is preferred. The architecture is straightforward, leveraging Flask's routing and request handling capabilities.

Key technologies include Python and Flask. The API follows a RESTful design, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. Its unique selling point is its simplicity and ease of customization, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and learning.
